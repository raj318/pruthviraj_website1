                    <p>Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on 
                        the internet. My interest in web development started back in 
                        2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns 
                        out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot 
                        about HTML & CSS!</p>
                    <p>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an 
                        advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a 
                        student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building 
                        accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at 
                        Upstatement for a variety of clients.</p>
                    <p>I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need 
                        to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
